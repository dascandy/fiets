Downcasts check if the actual type is derived from T and if so return the T* equivalent, otherwise returning a nullptr; Crosscasts are cases where the two types have no obvious relation, but allow for conversion from U to T if the actual type underlying the passed-in <span class="code">a</span> does implement T somewhere uniquely in its inheritance tree.</p><p>In general, code bases tend not to use many dynamic casts, and if they do a large portion of them are upcasts (sampled in 2014, code base of 7M lines, contained 128 dynamic_cast's of which 123 were upcasts or guaranteed downcasts, 4 checked downcasts and 1 crosscast). It is considered by some a "design smell" in that a "good" design uses the virtual functions to abstract away differences, seeing a dynamic_cast as a piercing of that abstraction to look at the underlying type anyway.</p><p>In those code bases, it would be desirable to restrict usage of dynamic_cast in general code.</p><h2 data-number="8.9" id="raw_new_delete--calling-new-or-delete--or-array-new-or-delete--are-not-allowed-"><span class="header-section-number">8.9</span> raw_new_delete: calling new or delete, or array new or delete, are not allowed.<a href="#raw_new_delete--calling-new-or-delete--or-array-new-or-delete--are-not-allowed-" class="self-link"></a></h2><p>In "Modern C++" it is possible to write code that only uses types that manage heap allocations for you, keeping your own code base free of any new or delete calls. In code bases like this it is desirable to be able to disable raw new and delete calls, so that no user code ends up doing manual memory management, even inadvertently or as a "temporary quick hack". </p><p>This does not disable creating operator new or operator delete overloads in classes, nor does it disable the ability to mark a function as <span class="code"><span class="special">=</span><span class="keyword">delete</span></span>.</p><h2 data-number="8.10" id="repeated_comparison--calling-any-of----------------------------or------with-the-result-of-a-comparison--from-the-same-list--is-not-allowed-"><span class="header-section-number">8.10</span> repeated_comparison: calling any of `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=` or `==` with the result of a comparison (from the same list) is not allowed.<a href="#repeated_comparison--calling-any-of----------------------------or------with-the-result-of-a-comparison--from-the-same-list--is-not-allowed-" class="self-link"></a></h2><p>This prevents use of the output of operators that take two comparable types and that normally result in a boolean result, from being used as the input to a binary operator itself. Code like this is often written by accident as the mathematical notation looks like correct code and often even compiles cleanly. This might be a candidate for actual deprecation or removal altogether, and if so it should not remain a suppressible rule.</p><h2 data-number="8.11" id="binary_op_on_bool--calling-binary-----or------or-unary-----on-a-boolean-expression-is-not-allowed-"><span class="header-section-number">8.11</span> binary_op_on_bool: calling binary `&` or `|`, or unary `~` on a boolean expression is not allowed.<a href="#binary_op_on_bool--calling-binary-----or------or-unary-----on-a-boolean-expression-is-not-allowed-" class="self-link"></a></h2><p>Often people forget that there are binary and boolean variants of the <span class="code"><span class="keyword">and</span></span> and <span class="code"><span class="keyword">or</span></span> operations.

These functions have well-defined behavior for this usage, but are usually not desired by being hard to read. </p><h2 data-number="8.12" id="throw_non_std_exception--throwing-anything-that-is-not-derived-from-std--exception-is-not-allowed-"><span class="header-section-number">8.12</span> throw_non_std_exception: throwing anything that is not derived from std::exception is not allowed.<a href="#throw_non_std_exception--throwing-anything-that-is-not-derived-from-std--exception-is-not-allowed-" class="self-link"></a></h2><p>The C++ language allows throwing any expression as exception. Catching any exception however is done with the <span class="code"><span class="special">...</span></span> syntax, that does not allow any introspection into the error.

If an object lifetime starts or ends between the goto point and the label it jumps to, the code is considered UB, which makes the statement itself hard to use meaningfully. In addition, it breaks structure of normal programming constructs somewhat similar to <span class="code"><span class="keyword">break</span></span> and <span class="code"><span class="keyword">continue</span></span>, except in an unstructured fashion making code harder to read.</p><h2 data-number="8.14" id="no_mixed_switch--the-case-labels-for-a-switch-statement-must-all-be-first-order-children-of-the-switch-body-"><span class="header-section-number">8.14</span> no_mixed_switch: the case labels for a switch statement must all be first-order children of the switch body.<a href="#no_mixed_switch--the-case-labels-for-a-switch-statement-must-all-be-first-order-children-of-the-switch-body-" class="self-link"></a></h2><p>In most code, switch cases are direct members of the switch statement itself.
